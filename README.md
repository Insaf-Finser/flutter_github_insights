## Project Overview for New Contributors

This project is structured to separate concerns and make contributions straightforward. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview:

### Major Folders

- **lib/**: Main Dart source code for the Flutter app.
  - **data/models/**: Data models for repositories, commits, collaborators, etc.
  - **riverpod/**: State management using Riverpod (providers for auth, routing, etc.).
  - **firebase_options.dart**: Firebase configuration.
  - **main.dart**: App entry point, initializes Firebase, Hive, and sets up providers.
- **screenshots/**: Contains screenshots referenced in the README and PRs.
- **android/**, **ios/**, **web/**: Platform-specific configuration for Flutter.
- **test/**: Unit and widget tests.

### Important Files

- `lib/main.dart`: App initialization, dependency setup, and root widget.
- `lib/riverpod/auth_provider.dart`: Handles authentication state.
- `lib/riverpod/router.dart`: App routing configuration.
- `lib/data/models/`: Contains all data models used throughout the app.

### Architecture & Component Interaction

- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter, using Riverpod for state management.
- **Backend**: Interacts with GitHubâ€™s REST API for data and Firebase for authentication.
- **Database**: Uses Hive (local NoSQL) for offline caching of repositories, commits, and collaborators.
- **Authentication**: Managed via Firebase Auth (OAuth with GitHub).
- **Routing**: Declarative navigation using Flutterâ€™s Router API and Riverpod.

### About The Project

The project is a Flutter application that integrates with Firebase Authentication to allow users to log in using their GitHub accounts. Once authenticated, users can view all their repositories, both private and public, and perform various actions such as creating new repositories and adding files to existing ones.

### Technical Implementation

**Build steps**
https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth ```keytool -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore```![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac7528a-fb52-4131-8d0f-64782b5d6af9)

**Auth Setup - Optional**
  * Enable authentication in your firebase project
  * Enable GitHub provider in Sign-in method
  * It requires clientId and client secret of your github developer OAuth app.
  * For that go to [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth App (or use existing if already exists)
  * Copy clientId and client secret of the OAuth app and paste them in the GitHub provider section of firebase
  * You will see a callback url in the github section of firebase. Use it as Authorization callback URL in GitHub
  * Use flutterfire to connect the flutter project to your firebase project ```flutterfire configure```

**Trouble Shooting**
SHA error - send your SHA key in whatsapp to repo author. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/787091fe-f850-4db4-b77c-778921923595)
